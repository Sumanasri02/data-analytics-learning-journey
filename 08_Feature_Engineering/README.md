# Feature Engineering

## What is Feature Engineering?
Feature Engineering is the process of creating, transforming,
and selecting features to improve machine learning model performance.

Well-engineered features can significantly increase model accuracy.

## Why Feature Engineering is Important

- Improves model performance
- Reduces overfitting
- Simplifies complex relationships
- Enhances interpretability

## Types of Feature Engineering

### 1. Feature Creation
- Polynomial features
- Interaction features
- Date-time features

### 2. Feature Transformation
- Log transformation
- Scaling & normalization
- Binning

### 3. Feature Encoding
- Label Encoding
- One-Hot Encoding
- Target Encoding

### 4. Feature Selection
- Correlation-based selection
- Variance threshold
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)

## Feature Engineering Workflow

1. Understand the problem
2. Analyze feature distributions
3. Create new meaningful features
4. Transform and scale features
5. Select important features

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Data leakage
- Over-engineering features
- Ignoring domain knowledge
- Creating features after train-test split

---

## Tools Used

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

---

## Key Takeaways

- Features matter more than algorithms
- Domain knowled
