# MLOps Basics

## What is MLOps?
MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is the practice of
deploying, monitoring, maintaining, and scaling
machine learning models in production.

---

## Why MLOps is Important

- Ensures reproducibility
- Automates ML workflows
- Tracks experiments
- Enables reliable deployment
- Reduces model failures

---

## ML Lifecycle

1. Data collection
2. Data validation
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training
5. Model evaluation
6. Model deployment
7. Monitoring & retraining

---

## Key MLOps Concepts

- Version control (Git)
- Data versioning
- Model versioning
- Experiment tracking
- CI/CD for ML
- Monitoring & logging

---

## Tools Overview

- Git & GitHub
- MLflow
- DVC
- Docker
- Cloud platforms (overview)

---

## Deployment Concepts

- Batch vs Real-time inference
- APIs (REST)
- Model serving
- Monitoring drift

---

## Key Takeaways

- MLOps bridges ML and production
- Automation improves reliability
- Tracking is mandatory in real projects
