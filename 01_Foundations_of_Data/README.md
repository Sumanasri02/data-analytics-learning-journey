# Foundations of Data

## Overview
Before analyzing or modeling data, it is essential to understand
what data is, how it is structured, and common issues found in real-world datasets.

This section builds the **core data understanding** required
for data analytics and machine learning.

## What is Data?

Data is a collection of facts, measurements, or observations
that can be analyzed to extract insights.

Examples:
- Student marks
- Sales records
- Website traffic
- Sensor readings

---

## Types of Data

### 1. Structured Data
- Organized in rows and columns
- Stored in databases or spreadsheets
- Easy to analyze

Example:
- Excel sheets
- SQL tables

---

### 2. Unstructured Data
- No fixed format
- Difficult to analyze directly

Example:
- Text documents
- Images
- Videos

---

### 3. Semi-Structured Data
- Partial structure
- Uses tags or metadata

Example:
- JSON
- XML
- Log files

---

## Data Types

### Numerical Data
- **Discrete**: Countable values (number of users)
- **Continuous**: Measurable values (temperature)

### Categorical Data
- **Nominal**: No order (gender, city)
- **Ordinal**: Ordered (ratings, grades)

---

## Data Quality Issues

Common problems in real datasets:
- Missing values
- Duplicate records
- Incorrect data types
- Outliers
- Inconsistent formatting

---

## Importance of Data Foundations

Understanding data foundations helps to:
- Clean data effectively
- Select proper analysis techniques
- Avoid incorrect conclusions
- Build reliable ML models

---

## Key Takeaways

- Not all data is clean or structured
- Data understanding comes before analysis
- Strong foundations lead to better insights and models
