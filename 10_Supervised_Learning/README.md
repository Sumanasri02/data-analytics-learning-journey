# Supervised Learning

## What is Supervised Learning?
Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning
where models are trained on labeled data.

The goal is to learn a mapping between input features (X)
and target output (y).

## Types of Supervised Learning

### 1. Regression
- Predicts continuous values

Examples:
- House price prediction
- Salary estimation

### 2. Classification
- Predicts categorical values

Examples:
- Spam detection
- Disease diagnosis
