# Python for Data Analytics

## Overview
Python is one of the most popular programming languages
for data analytics due to its simplicity and powerful libraries.

In analytics, Python is mainly used for:
- Data cleaning
- Data transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Preparing data for machine learning

---

## Why Python for Data Analytics?

- Easy to read and write
- Large ecosystem of data libraries
- Integrates well with databases and ML frameworks
- Widely used in industry

---

## Core Python Libraries for Analytics

### NumPy
- Numerical computations
- Arrays and mathematical operations
- Foundation for other libraries

---

### Pandas
- DataFrames and Series

- Data cleaning and manipulation
- Handling missing values

---

### Matplotlib
- Basic data visualization
- Line, bar, scatter plots

---

### Seaborn
- Statistical data visualization
- Built on top of Matplotlib
- Cleaner and informative charts

---

## Common Analytics Tasks Using Python

- Loading datasets
- Inspecting data (`head`, `info`, `describe`)
- Handling missing values
- Filtering and grouping data
- Creating new features

---

## Python in the Analytics Workflow

Python is typically used after:
- Extracting data using SQL
- Performing initial checks in Excel

It prepares data for:
- EDA
