# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## What is EDA?
Exploratory Data Analysis is the process of
analyzing datasets to summarize main characteristics,
often using visual methods.

EDA helps understand:
- Data structure
- Data quality
- Patterns and relationships
- Anomalies and outliers

---

## Objectives of EDA

- Understand dataset shape and features
- Identify missing and duplicate values
- Analyze data distributions
- Detect outliers
- Understand feature relationships

---

## Types of EDA

### 1. Univariate Analysis
- Analysis of a single variable
- Examples: histogram, boxplot

### 2. Bivariate Analysis
- Relationship between two variables
- Examples: scatter plot, correlation

### 3. Multivariate Analysis
- Relationship among multiple variables
- Examples: heatmaps, pair plots

---

## EDA Workflow

1. Load dataset
2. Basic inspection (`head`, `info`, `describe`)
3. Missing value analysis
4. Outlier detection
5. Feature distribution analysis
6. Relationship analysis
7. Insights & conclusions

---

## Tools Used

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## Importance for Machine Learning

EDA helps:
- Select important features
- Decide feature scaling
- Choose correct ML algorithms
- Improve model performance

---

## Key Takeaways

- EDA is mandatory before modeling
- Visualization reveals hidden patterns
- Good EDA leads to better ML decisions
